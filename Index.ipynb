Closer examination, however, reveals many subtle, and sometimes not-sosubtle, differences. Southeast Asia as a whole is a cornucopia of cultures, with hundreds of different languages and many distinct religions. Nestled between two dominant cultural hearths, China and India, and exhibiting a storied colonial past, Southeast Asia is a blend of indigenous and foreign elements. This diversity, not surprisingly, has been and continues to be inscribed on the region’s urban landscape, from the lotus-blossom-shaped stupas of Buddhist temples in Bangkok to the brightly colored Hindu temples in Singapore; and from the golden-domed Muslim mosques of Kuala Lumpur to the Roman Catholic cathedrals of Manila and Ho Chi Minh City. Yet for many travelers, the extent of Southeast Asia’s urban regions comes as a surprise. The typical image of the region is agrarian: thatched huts perched atop stilts and brilliant green rice paddies with water buffalo. The reality is very different. Flying over Manila, Bangkok, or Ho Chi Minh City is like flying over Los Angeles, New York, or Tokyo. The landscape reveals not a dense green three-tiered canopied jungle but instead a dense concrete jungle of apartment complexes, shopping malls, financial districts, and amusement parks. Southeast Asia’s major cities are focal points of political and cultural activity and centers of commercial circulation and exchange (Figure 10.1). Some, such as the “postsocialist” cities of Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, and Phnom Penh are undergoing phenomenal political and economic changes; others, such as Yangon (Rangoon) remain aloof from broader global trends. The cities of Southeast Asia are also sites of vast inequalities between the rich and the poor as well as the healthy and the malnourished. In Bangkok, Manila, and Jakarta, Toyota Land Cruisers and Louis Vuitton designer stores are as much a part of the urban landscape as are shantytowns and raw sewage. Beyond the limits of Southeast Asia’s primate cities are a host of medium, or intermediate, cities. Many, such as the Philippines’ Cebu and Thailand’s Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, are fast becoming important regional urban centers in their own right. And still other, predominantly rural areas, such as the Central Highlands of Vietnam, are sites of contestation and conflict resulting from indigenous land-use practices and national urban policies. The urban and urbanizing areas of Southeast Asia are more than just containers of people and commodities. They are agents in their own right and, in the coming years, will continue to influence, and be influenced by, local, national, and global affairs. In downtown Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, sits the mustard-colored Central Market. Built in the Art Deco style of the 1930s, the market is cruciform in design, with four halls radiating out from a central, cavernous dome. Inside, hundreds of vendors ply their wares. Care to buy hand-woven silks or a traditional Khmer scarf (known as krama)? Perhaps you’re in the mood for some fresh vegetables or pork? No matter your taste, whatever you seek can probably be found at Phnom Penh’s Central Market. And if not, it is but a short journey by motorbike to visit the city’s Russian Market. On the surface, the two markets are very much alike, with many of the same fruits, vegetables, and souvenirs found in each. However, the sweeping arches and vaulted ceilings of the Central Market give way to the Russian Market’s dimly lit and claustrophobic feel. The Russian Market is a rabbit den of activity, as shoppers jostle elbow-to-elbow with merchants and tourists. Inside, the air is stifling, a sweltering mix of too many people and too many cooking pots bubbling stews of fish and vegetables. Stepping inside any of Southeast Asia’s historic (and even new) markets is like Alice stepping into Wonderland. Whether you find yourself wandering the stuffy aisles of Binh Tay Market in Ho Chi Minh City, window-shopping in Bangkok’s upscale River City shopping complex, or sipping an iced coffee while shopping along Orchard Road in Singapore, you are guaranteed to be dazzled with new sights, sounds, and smells. The intoxicating aroma of sandalwood incense combines with the smells of fresh fruits, vegetables, and spices to provide an aromatic bouquet that is found nowhere else. And unlike the sedate, antiseptic shopping malls of North America, which are increasingly popping up in Southeast Asia, the labyrinthine markets of Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and elsewhere seem to embody much of the region’s urban geography. As a whole, Southeast Asia remains one of the least-urbanized regions of the world. Only four countries––Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, and Indonesia––are more than 50 percent urban. Other states are considerably more rural in character: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), and Vietnam, for example, are all less than 40 percent urbanized. However, recent years have seen many countries registering startling urban population growth rates in excess of 3 percent per year; and Cambodia and Laos stand at more than 6 percent. Such urban growth is not new to Southeast Asia (Figure 10.2). Before the Portuguese ever arrived in Malacca or the Spanish landed in the Philippines, Southeast Asia was home to some of the world’s most impressive cities: Angkor in Cambodia, Ayutthaya in Siam (now Thailand), and Luang Prabang in Laos. Their names continue to evoke rich histories of commerce and conquest. For it was through Southeast Asia that the fabled spice trade coursed. And it was through Southeast Asia that ships laden with goods from China, India, and beyond sailed. Then and now, the cities of Southeast Asia were centers of economic, religious, and cultural exchange.\nTowering glass-encased skyscrapers, flashing Coca-Cola signs, McDonald’s restaurants–– the increasingly universal symbols of central cities around the world––are very evident in the cities of Southeast Asia, especially the larger ones, giving the cities a deceiving sense of familiarity.
